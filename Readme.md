# Reciplay_website
There have been times when even after having enough ingredients at home, we can't decide what to make of it. This website called "Reciplay" is dedicated to solve this very problem using simple API fundamentals. Just enter the ingredients that you currently have and get random recipes, choose from them depending on your taste.
The API that is used here is Spoonacular API, which can educate people about the nutrition in the meals they have among many other uses like building a website like this one. :)
